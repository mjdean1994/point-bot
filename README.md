# Airhorn Bot 2.0

A recreation of [Discord's Airhorn Bot](https://github.com/discordapp/airhornbot) in NodeJS. The original project was built in Go and has since been discontinued. There were many changes to the Discord API since its creation, which made the initial bot's coding rather clunky towards the end of its life. The goal of this project is to breathe new life into the beloved bot and enhance its functionality further.
